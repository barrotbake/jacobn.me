              Most recently, I worked at InternMakers as a web development intern. I also currently serve as the president of the ACM student chapter at CSUF, where I get to grow an awesome community in tech.

              Outside of school and work-life, I really enjoy the art of coffee since I was a barista in my past life. If you ever wanna nerd out about caffeine, hit me up! Additionally, I love doing mentorship because I like to joke about being “past my prime,” and I want to pass forward the resources others have given me.
